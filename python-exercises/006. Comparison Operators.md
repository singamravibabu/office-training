# **Comparison Operators in Python**

Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

---

## 1. Equal to

```python
print(5 == 5)
```

Explanation: True because both sides are equal.

---

## 2. Not equal to

```python
print(5 != 3)
```

Explanation: True because 5 is not equal to 3.

---

## 3. Greater than

```python
print(10 > 4)
```

Explanation: True because 10 is larger.

---

## 4. Less than

```python
print(2 < 9)
```

Explanation: True because 2 is smaller.

---

## 5. Greater than or equal to

```python
print(7 >= 7)
```

Explanation: True because both sides are equal.

---

## 6. Less than or equal to

```python
print(3 <= 3)
```

Explanation: True because both sides are equal.

---

## 7. Comparing two equal floats

```python
print(3.5 == 3.5)
```

Explanation: Floats can be compared just like integers.

---

## 8. Comparing integer and float

```python
print(5 == 5.0)
```

Explanation: True because values are equal, even if types differ.

---

## 9. Float not equal to integer

```python
print(5 != 5.1)
```

Explanation: True because 5.1 is not equal to 5.

---

## 10. Greater than with negative numbers

```python
print(-2 > -5)
```

Explanation: -2 is greater because it is closer to zero.

---

## 11. Less than with negative numbers

```python
print(-10 < -3)
```

Explanation: -10 is smaller because it is further below zero.

---

## 12. Greater than or equal with mixed signs

```python
print(0 >= -1)
```

Explanation: Zero is greater than a negative number.

---

## 13. Less than or equal with mixed signs

```python
print(-1 <= 1)
```

Explanation: -1 is less than 1.

---

## 14. Comparing two different numbers

```python
print(8 > 12)
```

Explanation: False because 8 is not greater.

---

## 15. Comparing reversed

```python
print(8 < 12)
```

Explanation: True because 8 is smaller.

---

## 16. Comparing large values

```python
print(1000000 == 1000000)
```

Explanation: True for matching large integers.

---

## 17. Comparing very different values

```python
print(1 < 999999)
```

Explanation: True because 1 is much smaller.

---

## 18. Comparing floats in scientific notation

```python
print(1e3 == 1000.0)
```

Explanation: 1e3 equals 1000.0.

---

## 19. False comparison

```python
print(10 <= 5)
```

Explanation: False because 10 is not less than or equal to 5.

---

## 20. True comparison using <=

```python
print(5 <= 10)
```

Explanation: True because 5 is less than 10.
