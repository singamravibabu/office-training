# **The if statement (if clause only)**

---

## 1. Basic if with a true condition

```python
if 5 > 3:
    print("5 is greater than 3")
```

Explanation: Condition is true, so the message prints.

---

## 2. If with a false condition

```python
if 2 > 10:
    print("This will not print")
```

Explanation: Condition is false, so nothing happens.

---

## 3. If using equality

```python
if 7 == 7:
    print("Both numbers are equal")
```

Explanation: Condition is true.

---

## 4. If using inequality

```python
if 4 != 5:
    print("4 and 5 are different")
```

Explanation: Condition is true.

---

## 5. If using less-than

```python
if 3 < 9:
    print("3 is less than 9")
```

Explanation: Condition is true.

---

## 6. If using greater-than-or-equal

```python
if 10 >= 10:
    print("10 is equal to or greater than 10")
```

Explanation: True.

---

## 7. If with boolean True

```python
if True:
    print("This will always print")
```

Explanation: True is always true.

---

## 8. If with boolean False

```python
if False:
    print("This will never print")
```

Explanation: False is never true.

---

## 9. If with a mathematical expression

```python
if (2 + 3) == 5:
    print("The expression equals 5")
```

Explanation: 2+3 is 5, so condition is true.

---

## 10. If checking string equality

```python
if "cat" == "cat":
    print("Strings match")
```

Explanation: Both strings are the same.

---

## 11. If comparing different strings

```python
if "apple" != "orange":
    print("The words are different")
```

Explanation: Condition is true.

---

## 12. If checking length indirectly

```python
if "hello" == "hello":
    print("Same text")
```

Explanation: Equality works with strings.

---

## 13. If checking membership with in

```python
if "a" in "apple":
    print("The letter a is in apple")
```

Explanation: The letter exists in the string.

---

## 14. If checking a list membership

```python
if 3 in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("3 is in the list")
```

Explanation: 3 is present.

---

## 15. If checking boolean expression result

```python
if (10 > 5) and (5 > 2):
    print("Both conditions are true")
```

Explanation: Both comparisons are true.

---

## 16. If with or condition

```python
if (1 == 1) or (2 == 3):
    print("At least one condition is true")
```

Explanation: First condition is true.

---

## 17. If with not

```python
if not (5 < 3):
    print("Not true that 5 < 3")
```

Explanation: 5 < 3 is false; not false becomes true.

---

## 18. If comparing floats

```python
if 3.14 < 4.0:
    print("3.14 is less than 4.0")
```

Explanation: True.

---

## 19. If inside parentheses over multiple lines

```python
if (
    10 > 2
):
    print("Multiline condition works")
```

Explanation: Condition is valid and true.

---

## 20. If checking a list's truthiness

```python
if [1, 2, 3]:
    print("Non-empty list is True")
```

Explanation: Non-empty lists evaluate to True.
