# **The round() function**

The **round() function** is used to round numbers to a given number of decimal places.

---

## 1. Round a simple float

```python
print(round(3.14))
```

Explanation: Rounds 3.14 to the nearest whole number → 3.

---

## 2. Round a float that is closer to the next integer

```python
print(round(3.75))
```

Explanation: Closer to 4 → result is 4.

---

## 3. Round to one decimal place

```python
print(round(3.14159, 1))
```

Explanation: Rounds to one decimal place → 3.1.

---

## 4. Round to two decimal places

```python
print(round(3.14159, 2))
```

Explanation: Result → 3.14.

---

## 5. Round to three decimal places

```python
print(round(3.14159, 3))
```

Explanation: Result → 3.142.

---

## 6. Round a negative number

```python
print(round(-2.6))
```

Explanation: -2.6 rounds to -3.

---

## 7. Round a large float

```python
print(round(1234.567))
```

Explanation: Nearest integer → 1235.

---

## 8. Round a negative float with decimal places

```python
print(round(-3.14159, 2))
```

Explanation: Result → -3.14.

---

## 9. Round a whole number (no effect)

```python
print(round(50))
```

Explanation: Already an integer → 50.

---

## 10. Round a number ending in .5 (ties go to even)

```python
print(round(2.5))
```

Explanation: Python rounds .5 to the nearest even number → 2.

---

## 11. Another .5 rounding rule

```python
print(round(3.5))
```

Explanation: 3.5 rounds to 4 (nearest even).

---

## 12. Round a very small float

```python
print(round(0.00049, 3))
```

Explanation: Result → 0.0.

---

## 13. Round up due to next digit

```python
print(round(0.00051, 3))
```

Explanation: Result → 0.001.

---

## 14. Round with zero decimal places

```python
print(round(9.99, 0))
```

Explanation: Equivalent to rounding to the nearest whole → 10.0.

---

## 15. Round a float in scientific notation

```python
print(round(1.234e2, 1))
```

Explanation: 1.234e2 = 123.4 → round to 1 decimal → 123.4.

---

## 16. Round a negative float in scientific notation

```python
print(round(-2.55e1, 0))
```

Explanation: -2.55e1 = -25.5 → rounds to -26.0.

---

## 17. Round to many decimal places

```python
print(round(1.23456789, 6))
```

Explanation: Result → 1.234568.

---

## 18. Round an integer with decimal parameter

```python
print(round(100, 2))
```

Explanation: Still 100, because adding decimal places changes nothing.

---

## 19. Round the result of an expression

```python
print(round(10 / 3, 2))
```

Explanation: 10/3 ≈ 3.3333 → rounded to 3.33.

---

## 20. Round a negative fractional number with decimals

```python
print(round(-0.12345, 4))
```

Explanation: Result → -0.1235.
