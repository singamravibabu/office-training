# **Arithmetic Operators in Python**

Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`

---

## 1. Addition

```python
print(10 + 5)
```

Explanation: Adds two numbers.

---

## 2. Subtraction

```python
print(20 - 8)
```

Explanation: Subtracts the right value from the left.

---

## 3. Multiplication

```python
print(6 * 7)
```

Explanation: Multiplies two numbers.

---

## 4. Division

```python
print(25 / 5)
```

Explanation: Always gives a float result.

---

## 5. Floor Division

```python
print(27 // 4)
```

Explanation: Gives the whole-number quotient (no decimals).

---

## 6. Modulus (Remainder)

```python
print(27 % 4)
```

Explanation: Gives the remainder after division.

---

## 7. Exponent / Power

```python
print(3 ** 4)
```

Explanation: Raises 3 to the power of 4.

---

## 8. Add negative numbers

```python
print(-3 + 7)
```

Explanation: Arithmetic works with negative values.

---

## 9. Subtract a negative number

```python
print(10 - (-5))
```

Explanation: Subtracting a negative becomes addition.

---

## 10. Multiply negative numbers

```python
print(-4 * 6)
```

Explanation: Negative multiplied by positive gives negative.

---

## 11. Multiply two negatives

```python
print(-4 * -6)
```

Explanation: Negative multiplied by negative gives positive.

---

## 12. Division resulting in decimals

```python
print(7 / 2)
```

Explanation: Produces a floating-point number.

---

## 13. Floor division with negative numbers

```python
print(-7 // 2)
```

Explanation: Floor division rounds down to the smaller integer.

---

## 14. Modulus with negative numbers

```python
print(-7 % 2)
```

Explanation: Python's remainder keeps the sign of the divisor.

---

## 15. Power of zero

```python
print(5 ** 0)
```

Explanation: Any number to the power 0 is 1.

---

## 16. Zero raised to a power

```python
print(0 ** 5)
```

Explanation: Zero to any positive power is zero.

---

## 17. Large power

```python
print(2 ** 10)
```

Explanation: Demonstrates powers producing large numbers.

---

## 18. Combined operations (left to right)

```python
print(10 + 5 * 2)
```

Explanation: Multiplication has higher precedence than addition.

---

## 19. Use parentheses to change order

```python
print((10 + 5) * 2)
```

Explanation: Parentheses override normal precedence.

---

## 20. Multiple operators in one line

```python
print(100 // 3 % 5)
```

Explanation: Shows a sequence: floor division first, then modulus.
