# **Basic Escape Characters in Python**

Escape characters:
`\n` (newline)
`\t` (tab)
`\\` (backslash)
`\'` (single quote)
`\"` (double quote)
`\r` (carriage return)
`\b` (backspace)
`\f` (form feed)

---

## 1. Newline character

```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```

Explanation: `\n` moves text to a new line.

---

## 2. Two newlines

```python
print("A\n\nB")
```

Explanation: Two blank lines appear between A and B.

---

## 3. Tab character

```python
print("Name:\tJohn")
```

Explanation: `\t` inserts a horizontal tab space.

---

## 4. Tab between words

```python
print("Python\tProgramming")
```

Explanation: A tab creates a wide space between the two words.

---

## 5. Escaping double quotes

```python
print("He said \"Hello\"")
```

Explanation: `\"` allows quotes inside a string.

---

## 6. Escaping single quotes

```python
print('It\'s Python')
```

Explanation: `\'` protects the apostrophe.

---

## 7. Printing a backslash

```python
print("C:\\Folder\\File")
```

Explanation: `\\` prints a single backslash.

---

## 8. Backslash at the end

```python
print("Backslash: \\")
```

Explanation: Ends with a literal backslash.

---

## 9. Carriage return

```python
print("Hello\rWorld")
```

Explanation: `\r` returns to the beginning of the line before writing the next text.

---

## 10. Backspace character

```python
print("ABC\bD")
```

Explanation: `\b` erases the previous character visually in many terminals.

---

## 11. Form feed

```python
print("Page1\fPage2")
```

Explanation: `\f` represents a page break.

---

## 12. Combining tab and newline

```python
print("A\tB\nC\tD")
```

Explanation: Mixes tab and newline for structured output.

---

## 13. Escaping both quotes in one string

```python
print("She said \"It\'s okay\"")
```

Explanation: Demonstrates escaping double and single quotes together.

---

## 14. Multiline layout using escape characters

```python
print("Line1\n\tIndented Line2\nLine3")
```

Explanation: Tabs and newlines can format text like paragraphs.

---

## 15. Backslash before a quote

```python
print('She said: \"Yes\"')
```

Explanation: Using escaped double quotes inside single-quoted string.

---

## 16. Showing escape characters literally with raw string prefix removed (normal escape)

```python
print("Tab:\tHere")
```

Explanation: The actual tab is produced after “Tab:”.

---

## 17. Creating a simple table

```python
print("A\tB\tC\n1\t2\t3")
```

Explanation: Tabs align columns naturally.

---

## 18. Newline at the start

```python
print("\nStart")
```

Explanation: The text appears after one blank line.

---

## 19. Newline at the end

```python
print("End\n")
```

Explanation: A blank line appears after the text.

---

## 20. Using several escape sequences together

```python
print("ID:\t123\nName:\tJohn\\Doe")
```

Explanation: Shows a mix of newline, tab, and escaped backslash.
