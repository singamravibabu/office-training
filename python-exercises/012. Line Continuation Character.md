# **Line Continuation Character (`\`) in Python**

The line-continuation character **`\`** lets Python treat multiple lines as one logical line.

---

## 1. Break a long addition into two lines

```python
x = 10 + \
    20
```

Explanation: The backslash continues the expression on the next line.

---

## 2. Break multiplication across lines

```python
y = 5 * \
    4
```

Explanation: Python reads this as 5 * 4.

---

## 3. Continue a string literal (concatenation by adjacency)

```python
text = "Hello " \
       "World"
```

Explanation: Two string literals next to each other combine automatically.

---

## 4. Continue a list across lines

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, \
           4, 5, 6]
```

Explanation: The list continues after the backslash.

---

## 5. Continue a tuple across lines

```python
coords = (1, 2, \
          3, 4)
```

Explanation: Tuple values split into multiple lines.

---

## 6. Continue a dictionary across lines

```python
data = {"a": 1, \
        "b": 2}
```

Explanation: Key–value pairs spread across lines.

---

## 7. Break an assignment expression

```python
total = 100 + \
        50 + \
        25
```

Explanation: Multiple lines represent one long expression.

---

## 8. Continue a comparison expression

```python
check = 10 < \
        20
```

Explanation: Comparison spans multiple lines.

---

## 9. Break logical expression

```python
result = True and \
         False
```

Explanation: Logical operators can be on separate lines.

---

## 10. Continue arithmetic chain

```python
value = 1 + 2 + \
        3 + 4
```

Explanation: Arithmetic continues onto next line.

---

## 11. Break a long string into fragments

```python
msg = "Python " \
      "is " \
      "fun"
```

Explanation: Adjacent string literals join automatically.

---

## 12. Continue an expression inside parentheses (line continuation not required, but allowed)

```python
z = (1 + \
     2 + \
     3)
```

Explanation: Line continuation still works even though parentheses allow breaking.

---

## 13. Continue a long boolean chain

```python
flag = True or \
       False or \
       True
```

Explanation: Logical OR spans three lines.

---

## 14. Break an exponent expression

```python
power = 2 ** \
        5
```

Explanation: Exponent across multiple lines.

---

## 15. Continue a nested structure

```python
data2 = {"x": [1, 2, \
               3]}
```

Explanation: Backslash continues list inside dictionary.

---

## 16. Long list broken into several lines

```python
items = [1, \
         2, \
         3]
```

Explanation: Each value placed on a new line.

---

## 17. Continue a string with escape characters

```python
note = "Line1\n" \
       "Line2\n"
```

Explanation: Escape characters work normally.

---

## 18. Continue assignment of a float value expression

```python
result2 = 1.5 + \
          2.5
```

Explanation: Float arithmetic works across lines.

---

## 19. Continue a chained comparison

```python
valid = 5 < \
        10 < \
        20
```

Explanation: Multi-part comparison spread across lines.

---

## 20. Continue a long mathematical expression mixing operations

```python
calc = 100 - 20 + \
       5 * 2 - \
       10
```

Explanation: Long arithmetic expression becomes readable across lines.
