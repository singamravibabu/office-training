# **The type() function**

---

## 1. Type of an integer

```python
print(type(10))
```

Explanation: Shows that 10 is of type int.

---

## 2. Type of a float

```python
print(type(3.14))
```

Explanation: Floats represent decimal values.

---

## 3. Type of a string

```python
print(type("Hello"))
```

Explanation: Text enclosed in quotes is a string.

---

## 4. Type of a Boolean

```python
print(type(True))
```

Explanation: True and False are of type bool.

---

## 5. Type of a list

```python
print(type([1, 2, 3]))
```

Explanation: A list is a collection of ordered items.

---

## 6. Type of a tuple

```python
print(type((1, 2, 3)))
```

Explanation: A tuple is similar to a list but immutable.

---

## 7. Type of a dictionary

```python
print(type({"a": 1, "b": 2}))
```

Explanation: Dictionaries store key-value pairs.

---

## 8. Type of a set

```python
print(type({1, 2, 3}))
```

Explanation: A set stores unique unordered elements.

---

## 9. Type of None

```python
print(type(None))
```

Explanation: None represents “no value” and has its own type.

---

## 10. Type of a complex number

```python
print(type(2 + 3j))
```

Explanation: Python supports complex numbers.

---

## 11. Type of a long integer (Python 3: same as int)

```python
print(type(999999999999999999))
```

Explanation: Python int automatically expands for large values.

---

## 12. Type of a multiline string

```python
print(type("""Line1
Line2"""))
```

Explanation: Triple quotes produce a string type.

---

## 13. Type of a boolean expression result

```python
print(type(5 > 3))
```

Explanation: A comparison returns a Boolean value.

---

## 14. Type of arithmetic expression result

```python
print(type(10 / 2))
```

Explanation: Division always produces a float.

---

## 15. Type of an integer division result

```python
print(type(10 // 2))
```

Explanation: Floor division produces an int.

---

## 16. Type of a string created with quotes inside quotes

```python
print(type('She said "Hi"'))
```

Explanation: Still a string regardless of quote style.

---

## 17. Type of a list with mixed data types

```python
print(type([1, "A", 3.5, True]))
```

Explanation: Lists can store values of different types.

---

## 18. Type of a dictionary value

```python
print(type({"x": 10}["x"]))
```

Explanation: Accessing a key returns its value type.

---

## 19. Type of result of repeating a string

```python
print(type("Hi" * 3))
```

Explanation: Repetition of a string still produces a string.

---

## 20. Type of a nested structure

```python
print(type([{"a": 1}, (2, 3)]))
```

Explanation: Even complex nesting results in an outer list type.
