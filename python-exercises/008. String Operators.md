# **Basic Text Operators in Python**

**`+` for concatenation**
**`*` for repetition**

---

## 1. Basic concatenation

```python
print("Hello" + "World")
```

Explanation: Joins the two strings together.

---

## 2. Concatenation with a space

```python
print("Hello" + " " + "World")
```

Explanation: Inserts a space between words using string literals.

---

## 3. Concatenating three strings

```python
print("Python" + " " + "is" + " " + "fun")
```

Explanation: Multiple literal strings can be joined.

---

## 4. Concatenating numbers as text

```python
print("123" + "456")
```

Explanation: Numbers inside quotes are treated as text, so they join.

---

## 5. Concatenating symbols

```python
print("@" + "#" + "$")
```

Explanation: Any characters in quotes can be concatenated.

---

## 6. Concatenation forming a sentence

```python
print("Learning" + " Python" + " programming")
```

Explanation: Creates a longer sentence by joining literals.

---

## 7. Repeating a string once

```python
print("Hi" * 1)
```

Explanation: Multiplying by 1 prints it once.

---

## 8. Repeating a string twice

```python
print("Hi" * 2)
```

Explanation: Repetition operator duplicates the text.

---

## 9. Repeating a string five times

```python
print("A" * 5)
```

Explanation: Prints AAAAA.

---

## 10. Repeating a word several times

```python
print("Python" * 3)
```

Explanation: Prints the word three times continuously.

---

## 11. Repeating with spaces included

```python
print("Hi " * 4)
```

Explanation: Space inside the literal helps separate repetitions.

---

## 12. Combining concatenation and repetition

```python
print("Hello" + "!" * 3)
```

Explanation: Creates Hello!!! by repeating the exclamation mark.

---

## 13. Concatenating repeated patterns

```python
print("AB" * 2 + "CD")
```

Explanation: "AB" is repeated, then "CD" is added.

---

## 14. Long repeated pattern

```python
print("-" * 20)
```

Explanation: Creates a horizontal line using repetition.

---

## 15. Pattern border around text

```python
print("*" * 5 + "Hello" + "*" * 5)
```

Explanation: Surrounds the text with repeated symbols.

---

## 16. Repeating a phrase multiple times

```python
print("Go " * 3)
```

Explanation: Produces "Go Go Go ".

---

## 17. Concatenating empty strings

```python
print("" + "Python" + "")
```

Explanation: Empty strings do not change the content.

---

## 18. Repeating empty string

```python
print("" * 10)
```

Explanation: Repeating an empty string still prints nothing.

---

## 19. Combining text and newline character

```python
print("Line1\n" + "Line2")
```

Explanation: The newline escape prints Line2 on a new line.

---

## 20. Creating a box-like structure

```python
print("+" + "-" * 5 + "+")
```

Explanation: Builds a simple text border using repetition and concatenation.
