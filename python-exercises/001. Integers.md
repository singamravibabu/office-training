# **Integers in Python**

---

## 1. Print a positive integer

```python
print(10)
```

Explanation: This is a basic integer literal.

---

## 2. Print a negative integer

```python
print(-5)
```

Explanation: Integers can be positive or negative.

---

## 3. Print zero

```python
print(0)
```

Explanation: Zero is also an integer.

---

## 4. Print a large integer

```python
print(999999999999)
```

Explanation: Python supports very large integers without limits.

---

## 5. Print a small integer

```python
print(3)
```

Explanation: Small integers behave the same as large ones.

---

## 6. Print an integer with underscores

```python
print(1_000_000)
```

Explanation: Underscores improve readability but still represent the same integer.

---

## 7. Print an integer in binary form

```python
print(0b1010)
```

Explanation: A binary literal representing the integer 10.

---

## 8. Print an integer in octal form

```python
print(0o12)
```

Explanation: An octal literal also representing the integer 10.

---

## 9. Print an integer in hexadecimal form

```python
print(0xA)
```

Explanation: A hexadecimal literal, also equal to 10.

---

## 10. Print a negative binary integer

```python
print(-0b111)
```

Explanation: Negative binary literal; equals -7.

---

## 11. Print a negative hexadecimal integer

```python
print(-0xF)
```

Explanation: Negative hexadecimal literal; equals -15.

---

## 12. Print an integer representing a Unicode code point

```python
print(65)
```

Explanation: 65 is just an integer (ASCII for 'A', but here treated only as a number).

---

## 13. Print repeated integer literals (multiple integers in one line)

```python
print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

Explanation: Multiple integer literals can be printed together.

---

## 14. Print a very large negative integer

```python
print(-12345678901234567890)
```

Explanation: Python easily handles very large negative integers.

---

## 15. Print integers that look like different bases (just numbers)

```python
print(10)
print(010)   # invalid in Python, so not used
print(0o10)  # proper octal form
```

Explanation: Python does not allow integers with a leading zero, but base prefixes like `0o` are valid.
