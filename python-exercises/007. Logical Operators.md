# **Logical Operators in Python**

Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.

---

## 1. True and True

```python
print(True and True)
```

Explanation: Both sides are True, so the result is True.

---

## 2. True and False

```python
print(True and False)
```

Explanation: and returns True only if both sides are True.

---

## 3. False and True

```python
print(False and True)
```

Explanation: Since one side is False, the result is False.

---

## 4. False and False

```python
print(False and False)
```

Explanation: Both sides are False, so the result is False.

---

## 5. True or True

```python
print(True or True)
```

Explanation: or returns True if at least one side is True.

---

## 6. True or False

```python
print(True or False)
```

Explanation: True or anything is True.

---

## 7. False or True

```python
print(False or True)
```

Explanation: One side is True, so result is True.

---

## 8. False or False

```python
print(False or False)
```

Explanation: Both are False, so result is False.

---

## 9. not True

```python
print(not True)
```

Explanation: not flips True to False.

---

## 10. not False

```python
print(not False)
```

Explanation: not flips False to True.

---

## 11. not with a complex expression

```python
print(not (True and False))
```

Explanation: True and False is False, so not False becomes True.

---

## 12. Combining and and or

```python
print(True and True or False)
```

Explanation: and is evaluated before or, so the result is True.

---

## 13. Another combination

```python
print(True or False and False)
```

Explanation: False and False is False, then True or False is True.

---

## 14. Using parentheses to change order

```python
print((True or False) and False)
```

Explanation: Parentheses run first: True or False is True. Then True and False is False.

---

## 15. Double not

```python
print(not not True)
```

Explanation: not True is False, not False is True.

---

## 16. Triple logical combination

```python
print(True and False or True)
```

Explanation: True and False is False, then False or True is True.

---

## 17. Another mixed example

```python
print(False or True and False)
```

Explanation: True and False is False, then False or False is False.

---

## 18. Using True in a chain

```python
print(True and True and False)
```

Explanation: All must be True for and to be True; final result is False.

---

## 19. Using False in a chain

```python
print(False or False or True)
```

Explanation: or returns True if any one is True; result is True.

---

## 20. Full combination

```python
print(not False or False and True)
```

Explanation: not False is True. Then True or (False and True) → True or False → True.
