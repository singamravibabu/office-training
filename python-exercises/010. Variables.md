# **Variables in Python**

---

## 1. Assign an integer to a variable

```python
x = 10
```

Explanation: The value 10 is stored in the variable x.

---

## 2. Assign a float to a variable

```python
pi = 3.14
```

Explanation: Variables can store decimal values.

---

## 3. Assign a string to a variable

```python
name = "John"
```

Explanation: Variables can store text enclosed in quotes.

---

## 4. Assign a Boolean value

```python
is_valid = True
```

Explanation: Variables can store True or False values.

---

## 5. Reassign a variable to a new value

```python
x = 10
x = 20
```

Explanation: The old value is replaced by the new one.

---

## 6. Assign one variable to another

```python
a = 5
b = a
```

Explanation: b now holds the same value stored in a.

---

## 7. Store a negative number

```python
temperature = -15
```

Explanation: Variables can store negative integers.

---

## 8. Store long text in a variable

```python
message = "Python is powerful"
```

Explanation: Strings can be long or short.

---

## 9. Use underscores in variable names

```python
user_age = 25
```

Explanation: Underscores make variable names readable.

---

## 10. Use letters and numbers in variable names

```python
id123 = 987
```

Explanation: Variables may contain numbers but cannot *start* with them.

---

## 11. Reassign a variable to a different type

```python
value = 10
value = "Ten"
```

Explanation: Python allows variables to change data types.

---

## 12. Assign multiple variables separately

```python
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
```

Explanation: Each variable stores its own value.

---

## 13. Multiple assignment in one line

```python
x, y = 5, 10
```

Explanation: Two variables receive two different values.

---

## 14. Same value to multiple variables

```python
a = b = c = 0
```

Explanation: All three variables hold the value 0.

---

## 15. Store a large integer

```python
big = 999999999999
```

Explanation: Python supports very large integers.

---

## 16. Store a float in scientific notation

```python
distance = 1.5e6
```

Explanation: Scientific notation is allowed for floats.

---

## 17. Store a multiline string

```python
text = """This is
a multiline
string"""
```

Explanation: Triple quotes allow storing multiple lines.

---

## 18. Store a list in a variable

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
```

Explanation: Variables can store collections.

---

## 19. Store a dictionary in a variable

```python
info = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
```

Explanation: Variables can hold key-value pairs.

---

## 20. Use a variable name that describes the data

```python
total_students = 35
```

Explanation: Good variable names make code easy to understand.
