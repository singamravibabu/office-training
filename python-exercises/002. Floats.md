# **Floats in Python**

---

## 1. Print a simple float

```python
print(1.5)
```

Explanation: A float is a number with a decimal point.

---

## 2. Print a negative float

```python
print(-3.2)
```

Explanation: Floats can be positive or negative.

---

## 3. Print zero as a float

```python
print(0.0)
```

Explanation: Zero can be written with a decimal to make it a float.

---

## 4. Print a large float

```python
print(1234567.89)
```

Explanation: Floats can represent large values.

---

## 5. Print a small float

```python
print(0.25)
```

Explanation: Floats can represent very small values.

---

## 6. Print a float with many decimal places

```python
print(3.1415926535)
```

Explanation: Python accepts long decimal values.

---

## 7. Print a float in scientific notation

```python
print(1.5e3)
```

Explanation: Scientific notation means 1.5 × 10³, which equals 1500.0.

---

## 8. Scientific notation with a negative exponent

```python
print(2.5e-4)
```

Explanation: This equals 0.00025.

---

## 9. Negative scientific notation

```python
print(-4.2e2)
```

Explanation: This equals -420.0.

---

## 10. Print a float representing a whole number

```python
print(10.0)
```

Explanation: Although it looks like 10, the decimal makes it a float.

---

## 11. Print a float without digits before decimal

```python
print(.75)
```

Explanation: Starting with a decimal is allowed.

---

## 12. Print a float without digits after decimal

```python
print(5.)
```

Explanation: Ending with a decimal automatically makes it a float.

---

## 13. Print a very small float using scientific notation

```python
print(1e-10)
```

Explanation: Represents a very tiny number.

---

## 14. Print a very large float using scientific notation

```python
print(9.99e20)
```

Explanation: Scientific notation is convenient for huge values.

---

## 15. Print multiple float literals together

```python
print(1.1, 2.2, 3.3)
```

Explanation: Multiple float literals can be printed in the same statement.
