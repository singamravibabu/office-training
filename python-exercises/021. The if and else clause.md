# **The if–else statement**

Each example includes **only if and else**, no `elif`.

---

## 1. Basic if–else

```python
if 5 > 3:
    print("5 is greater")
else:
    print("3 is greater")
```

Explanation: Condition is true, so the first block runs.

---

## 2. False condition example

```python
if 2 > 10:
    print("This will not run")
else:
    print("Condition was false")
```

Explanation: Condition is false, so else runs.

---

## 3. Check equality

```python
if 7 == 7:
    print("Equal")
else:
    print("Not equal")
```

Explanation: 7 equals 7, so if block runs.

---

## 4. Compare strings

```python
if "apple" == "orange":
    print("Same")
else:
    print("Different")
```

Explanation: Strings differ, so else runs.

---

## 5. Check for membership

```python
if "a" in "banana":
    print("Found")
else:
    print("Not found")
```

Explanation: "a" is in "banana", so if runs.

---

## 6. Check list membership

```python
if 3 in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("Present")
else:
    print("Absent")
```

Explanation: 3 is present.

---

## 7. Check boolean value

```python
if True:
    print("True block")
else:
    print("False block")
```

Explanation: True always triggers if.

---

## 8. Check another boolean

```python
if False:
    print("Will not run")
else:
    print("Else runs")
```

Explanation: False triggers else.

---

## 9. Math expression

```python
if (2 + 3) == 5:
    print("Correct")
else:
    print("Incorrect")
```

Explanation: Expression equals 5.

---

## 10. Float comparison

```python
if 3.14 < 3.15:
    print("Smaller")
else:
    print("Larger")
```

Explanation: Condition is true.

---

## 11. Use and inside condition

```python
if (10 > 5) and (5 > 2):
    print("Both true")
else:
    print("At least one false")
```

Explanation: Both comparisons are true.

---

## 12. Use or inside condition

```python
if (1 == 2) or (3 == 3):
    print("At least one true")
else:
    print("Both false")
```

Explanation: Second condition is true.

---

## 13. Use not inside condition

```python
if not (10 < 5):
    print("Inside if")
else:
    print("Inside else")
```

Explanation: not(False) = True.

---

## 14. Check empty list

```python
if []:
    print("Non-empty")
else:
    print("Empty")
```

Explanation: Empty lists are considered False.

---

## 15. Check non-empty list

```python
if [1, 2]:
    print("List has items")
else:
    print("List is empty")
```

Explanation: Non-empty lists evaluate to True.

---

## 16. Check empty string

```python
if "":
    print("Not empty")
else:
    print("Empty string")
```

Explanation: Empty string is False.

---

## 17. Check non-empty string

```python
if "Hello":
    print("String has content")
else:
    print("String is empty")
```

Explanation: Non-empty strings are True.

---

## 18. Using parentheses across lines

```python
if (
    10 > 2
):
    print("True condition")
else:
    print("False condition")
```

Explanation: Condition is true.

---

## 19. Compare two variables

```python
a = 10
b = 20
if a < b:
    print("a is smaller")
else:
    print("a is not smaller")
```

Explanation: 10 < 20, so if runs.

---

## 20. Combining arithmetic + condition

```python
if (5 * 2) == 10:
    print("Math is correct")
else:
    print("Math is incorrect")
```

Explanation: Expression equals 10, so if block prints.
